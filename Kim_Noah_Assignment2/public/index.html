        Noah's Mac Shack is an Authorized Apple Retailer
        <br>
        Message from founder: During winter break before the Spring 2021 semester began, I was faced with a difficult decision as my main laptop died. I contemplated between a Mac or a PC system but due to my first semester of MIS approaching, I needed a device fast.
        <br>
        I was quickly attracted to the newly released M1 Apple products that were user-friendly, budget-friendly, and capable. My options were simple, there were no longer confusing terminology or the bulkiness that most PC alternatives offered at various price ranges with various specs. 
        <br> I started this business to simplify YOUR options and this is why our product offering only includes the newest 2020 M1 and H1 chipped products.
